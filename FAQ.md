## How do I get the Elemental Rang checks?

As of version 1.1.10 and previous, the elemental rang conditions are incorrect. This is a known issue and will be fixed in the next update. The documentation is also incorrect for this check as well as the apworld leading to a potential impossible seed (though unlikely). To obtain the elemental rang checks you'll need to be given the talisman for that rang's hub boss as well as checking 17 Thunder Eggs of the rang's hub type. So for the Flamerang check you'd need the Frog Talisman and you'll also need to check 17 Fire Thunder Eggs (***NOT*** BE GIVEN 17 THUNDER EGG ITEMS*)

## Does the mod manager auto update?

No. You need to manually update the mod. This is to avoid github api usage limits. To update, go to the mod directory and click the download button. In the future, the mod manager may have an update button directly on the listing in My Mods

## How do I get past the ice blocks?

Get 100 opals then charge a bite by holding right click. Charge it fully then release towards the ice blocks. If you can't get 100 opals, collect all opals and obtain the Thunder Egg. Then reload the level and all opals will return.

The Flamerang, Kaboomerang, and Zappy rang all break the ice blocks.

## How do I get the bilbies behind cobwebs?

Assuming you're talking about an in-logic bilby, it's probably a bunyip stone somewhere in the level (the weird mech thing). They can smash the bilby crates.

## Can I turn the opal checks off?

No, but there's an option in the mod manager codes to reduce the opal requirement
